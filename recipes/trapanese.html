        <li>300g/10½oz cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>50g/1¾oz pecorino cheese (or vegetarian hard cheese), grated, plus extra to serve</li>

        <li>Toast the almonds in a dry frying pan over medium–high heat. Keep them moving to prevent burning; they should be a light golden colour.</li>

        <li>Mix in the tomatoes, pecorino and oil. Season with the salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring a pan of salted water to the boil and cook the pasta until al dente. Drain it and stir the pesto through. Serve, garnished with basil, with plenty of pecorino.</li>
